## My Game:

URL to Game: https://medunn626.github.io/TicTacToe/index.html

This game was created as part of the first project during the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly on 10/2/17.

My Tic Tac Toe game is a SPA where two players (X and O) play against each other on a 3 by 3 grid to try to get three letters in a row, column or diagonal path. The game defaults to player X going first each round. The game also keeps track of how many games won by each player, how many turns the last game took to achieve a win and by which player, as well as how many games have been played altogether.

## Planning & Development Process:

The process for developing this app was as follows:
- Review requirements
- Sketch wireframes and come up with user stories
- Create HTML and CSS files to built out the look and feel of the app.
- Create JavaScript files to process the game board.
- Create Auth shell files for sign up, sign in, change password and sign out.
- Remodel existing HTML, CSS and JS files for new auth functionality.
- Create API shell files for create, update and get games.
- Remodel existing HTML, CSS and JS files for new api functionality.
- Test the app from a user persepctive and take note of any defects.
- Provide finishing touches such as bug fixes and styling.

## Unsolved Problems:

I would like to resolve the following problems for a future release:

- App doesn't keep track of who won and how many turns beyond the previous game
- Two players cannot play from separate devices
- Make code more modular with more files and less lines of code per file

## User Stories:

1. As a mobile user, I want to be able to have all functions on a single screen so that I can easily navigate on a smaller screen
2. As a competitive user, I want to be able to see my score and my opponent's score so I can see who won
3. As a frequent user, I want to be able to create an account so that my game history will be saved
4. As a user who has access to many game apps, I want this app to stand out visually so that I am aesthetically pleased while using this app
5. As a user without a lot of time, I want this app to be intuitive so that I do not have to spend more time trying to understand the directions
6. As a non-computer savvy user, I want the game to clearly tell me if I am doing something incorrectly as well as when I have done something correctly.
